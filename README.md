# Neighborhood Map Project

The Neighborhood Map Project is the final project of the Frontend Web-Development course of Udacity, and it features all learned utilities in one project. All in all, the Neighborhood map shows a map (Google Map API) and shows specific markers on it, that mark points of interest - in this case its emergency services in Innsbruck. A list of all markers is given and an information window will give further looks into the locations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have create-react-app installed. It is not essential, but is a practical tool to start your own react-app! If it is not installed yet, then enter that command in the cmd-window:

```
$ npm install -g create-react-app
```

And make sure you have create-react-app as a system variable in your **PATH**.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Clone this repository
2. Cd into it
3. Install all modules by using

```
$ npm install
```
4. Start the server by simply writing

```
$ npm start
```
The command window should look like this then:

## Third Party API

I used unsplash as the needed third party API, because I could not find another API in time, to fit the topic of emergency services. To show the ability of making async-fetch requests, that had to do.

## Deployment

If you want to create a deployment build, simply write

```
$ npm run build
```
